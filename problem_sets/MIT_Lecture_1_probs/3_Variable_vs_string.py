## 3: Variable vs. String: Determine which of the following is a variable name and which is a string: spam and 'spam'.

spam = 'I am a variable';

# If we have a variable, it will print a value.
# In case the variable is empty, it will crash the code.
# For a string, it will print itself the way it should.
print(spam)
print('spam')
