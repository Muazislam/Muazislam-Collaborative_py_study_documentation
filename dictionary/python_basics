# 1: Conform
# comply with rules, standards, or laws.

#---------------------------

# 2: Passively

# In coding and computer science,
# passive (or acting "passively") generally refers to components, 
# data structures, or systems that do not take initiative, consume 
# resources without generating them, or wait to be acted upon by another 
# part of the system (the "active" part). 

#---------------------------

# 3: Data Aquisition function

# In coding and software engineering, a data acquisition (DAQ) function refers 
# to a programmatic routine, library method, or API call designed to collect, 
# sample, and convert physical, analog, or real-world signals into digital data 
# that a computer can store, analyze, or process.

#---------------------------

# 4: Validation or Evaluation function

# In coding, validation and evaluation functions are routines designed to ensure 
# data integrity, verify user input, or assess the performance of an algorithm or 
# model. They act as "gatekeepers" or "judges" within the code, often returning a 
# boolean (true/false) or a numerical score to guide program flow.

#---------------------------


# 5: Standard Input

# Standard input (often abreviated as stdin) is the default data stream from which the
# program reads input during execution.
# In most interactive programs, standard input corresponds to keyboard input provided by the user.
# In python, the input() function reads data from standard input and returns it to the program.

#---------------------------

# 6: Syntactic or semantic validation

# This refers to two forms of correctness checking:

# Syntactic validation: Verification that conforms to the formal structure or 
# grammar of a language(i.e. correct arrangment of symbols).
# Example: whether 3+*5 follows Python grammar -- it does not.

# Semantic validation: Verification that input is meaningful and logically valid 
# within a given context.
# Example: dividing by zero or using a string where a number is required.

# When we say a function does **not perform syntactic or semantic validation**, 
# it means it **does not analyze correctness, meaning, or suitability** of the input.
