The variable `seconds` is assigned the result of the arithmetic expression `(42 * 60) + 42` which computes to the total number of seconds contained in 42 minutes and 42 seconds. The expression applies the invariant that one minute equals 60 seconds and adds the remaining seconds to the final value.

The `print()` function then outputs this value using an f-string, where the variable `seconds` is interpolated into the output string to produce a human-readable result.
